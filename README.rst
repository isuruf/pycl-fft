pycl-fft: PyOpenCL bindings to FFT libraries
============================================

``pycl-fft`` provides thin, PyOpenCL-based bindings to `VkFFT <https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT>`_
and `clFFT <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT>`_, libraries implementing GPU-accelerated
Fast Fourier Transforms.
It also provides convenient wrappers that expose ``numpy``- and ``scipy``-like interfaces.

``pycl-fft`` is `fully documented <https://pycl-fft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
and is licensed under the liberal `MIT license
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`_.
